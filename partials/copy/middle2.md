Ollie Dabbous’s remarkable career started in London and spanned Paris to New York before bringing him back to where it began. Michelin-starred Dabbous in the West End is Ollie’s first solo venture, a celebration of clean flavours and simple presentation and a staggering success artistically, critically and commercially. 

The restaurant goes from strength to strength and “Dabbous” has become synonymous with quality and TK.
